After many months of slow progress, we've finally released our game's beta! If you'd like to try the game, please register for the beta at <a href="https://t.co/oYz8Qu0LnR">bit.ly/PolymerBeta</a>. We've added tons of new features for the beta, including joysticks, a new powerup, deadly new enemies, and all kinds of new animations to make the game more polished. Our team has expanded greatly to make all this possible, and we'll be introducing everyone soon! In the meantime, check out our sick trailer below and <a href="https://t.co/oYz8Qu0LnR">sign up for the Polymer beta</a>!
